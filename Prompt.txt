Hello I am a graduating computer engineering that wants to create a web app for SME in logistic trucking industry. I want to create a Fleet Management System web app with three of the following core features:



1. Trip Scheduling System

2. Inventory Management 

3. Billing System



I wanted to create a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) first including only the Trip Scheduling System. I want to include these features:



1. Automated Trip Planning - Generates optimized schedules based on routes, truck capacity and driver availability.

2. Live Tracking and Status Updates - Real-time visibility of delivery progress and vehicle location.

3. Driver & Vehicle Assignment - When scheduling a trip, the dispatcher can select available driver and vehicle depending on their availability.

4. Analytics Dashboard - Provides performance reports for trip efficiency and on-time delivery rates.



I also want the web app to have these functionalities:

1. I created a web app UI interface using Google AI Studio, I attached the files in this prompt to use it as your reference. Don't change the styling and interface that I made, I just want to add functionalities and integrate it with backend and database.

2. I want the web app UI to be accessed online, meaning the web app and its database is deployed in the cloud. 

3. I also included a postgresql database query and attached it into this prompt as you reference. Can you use this query to build the database for this web app?

4. Make this MVP scalable in the future so that other systems and features can be added easily.


Here is a quick flowchart of the web app:

1. User logs into the login window. There are two main roles: SuperAdmin and User.
	a. SuperAdmin has permissions to all of the features in the hub and has access to user management.
	b. User also has limited permissions to the features in the hub. It can only access the AppModules given by the SuperAdmin in the access permissions

2. The hub contains the AppModules which are accessed only by the SuperAdmin. Other User Roles jump straight to the main UI interface which contains sidebar, appnavbar and etc.

3. In the main UI, it consists of the following:
	a. AppNavBar at the top to navigate to other AppModules that can only be accessed depending on the access permissions by the SuperAdmin.
	b. Sidebar which contains the following:
		i. Dashboard - part of MenuItems in the sidebar which contains the real-time performance metrics of the trip schedule. It displays the total fuel costs, active trips, scheduled trips and maintenance trucks, it also consists of a line graph related to the trips.
		ii. Trip Management - advanced features for trip planning and execution. This part will be added in the future.
		iii. Trip Schedule - manage dispatching and trip schedule. A new trip modal will pop up if the user wants to add new trip advice.
		iv. Truck Management - manage fleet inventory and vehicle status. A modal called add vehicle will popup if the user wants to add new truck.
		v. Employee Directory - manages personnel, drivers, helpers and other employees.
		vi. Settings - has user management for SuperAdmin role where he/she gives permissions to the accessed App for each of the employees. the appearance theme of the app is also available to enable light or dark mode. 
		vii. Logout - logs out the user.


Also, I wanted to use these following tech stack for the web app:

1. For frontend, I want to use React.js

2. For backend, I want to use Django and RestAPI

3. For the database, I want to use PostgresQL


I add the files in the GitHub which I created using Google AI Studio which are codes for UI interfaces. Here is the GitHub link for your reference: https://github.com/jethromoleno/CloudyMVP . Also I created a database schema for PostgreSQL in the Database.txt file.


Can you help me create a prompt for my coding assistant to help build the code for the MVP? Give me a quick summary first of what you understand before you give me a prompt for my coding assistant. Wait for my Go signal before you give me a prompt.
